## About Me

Hi, my name is Tyler (oraqlle online). I am a second year university student and a passionate developer. I have working with many different languages on many different projects. This includes the languages C++, Python, Rust, Java, Bash, C and BQN. I am interest in language design, compilers, games and application development and library development. I started programming in C++ in 2018 and still predominately use it today for personal projects. I am keen to explore more of Rust as well as explore and design my own programming language.

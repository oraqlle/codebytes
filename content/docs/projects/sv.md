SV is a simple sorting visualizer programming using C++20 and SFML. Users can run many different sorting algorithms with randomly generated starting values. It is built using C++, [bpt](https://bpt.pizza/docs/latest/index.html) and SFML.

## Supported sorting algorithms

The included sorting algorithms in SV are:

- Bubble sort
- Bubble sort II
- Bucket sort
- Counting sort
- Insertion sort
- Introsort
- Heapsort
- Mergesort
- Pancake sort
- Quicksort
- Radix sort
- Selection sort
- Shellsort
- Timsort
